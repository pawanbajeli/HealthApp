Gas in your digestive system is part of the normal 
process of digestion. Getting rid of excess gas,
 either by burping or passing gas (flatus), also 
is normal. Gas pain may occur if gas is trapped 
or not moving well through your digestive system.

An increase in gas or gas pain may result from 
eating foods that are more likely to produce gas.
 Often, relatively simple changes in eating habits
 can lessen bothersome gas.

Certain digestive system disorders, such as 
irritable bowel syndrome or celiac disease, 
may cause — in addition to other signs and 
symptoms — an increase in gas or gas pain.
