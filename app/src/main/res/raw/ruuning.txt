Running every day may have some health benefits.
 Studies show that running just 5 to 10 minutes
 each day at a moderate pace may help reduce your
 risk of death from heart attacks, strokes, and 
other common diseases. But the same research also 
shows that these benefits top off at 4.5 hours a 
week, meaning thereâ€™s no need to run for hours each
 day. Running is a high-impact exercise and overtraining
 can lead to injuries such as stress fractures and shin splints.
