Digestive problems are considered the most common 
cause of abdominal pain. Discomfort or irregularities
 in any organ or part of the abdomen can cause pain 
that radiates throughout the entire area.

Many people refer to abdominal pain simply as a 
stomachache. However, the abdomen contains many vital 
organs, muscles, blood vessels, and connective tissues that include:

stomach
kidneys
liver
small and large intestines
the appendix
pancreas
gallbladder
spleen
