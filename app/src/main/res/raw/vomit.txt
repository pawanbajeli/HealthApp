A person with nausea has the sensation that vomiting may
occur. Other signs that you are about to vomit include
 gagging, retching, choking, involuntary stomach reflexes,
 the mouth filling with saliva (to protect the teeth from
 stomach acid), and the need to move or bend over.

If you feel nauseous, resting either in a sitting position
 or in a propped lying position can help; activity may
 worsen nausea and may lead to vomiting.

Pregnant women experiencing morning sickness can eat some
 crackers before getting out of bed or eat a high protein
 snack before going to bed (like lean meat or cheese).
