Meditation is something anyone can do, 
anytime, anywhere — even someplace loud. 
It’s easy to learn and involves some 
pretty basic techniques. Like anything new
, the more we meditate, the more comfortable
 we’ll get spending time with our mind.

It doesn’t take long to feel the benefits of 
a regular meditation practice. Research shows 
that Headspace can reduce stress in 10 days. 
And thousands of studies have shown mindfulness
 and meditation can positively impact mental and 
physical health. So, no matter why we want to 
start meditating — to feel less stressed, get
 better sleep, be more focused, or improve 
relationships — every meditation is one step 
closer to building healthier habits for a happier mind.
