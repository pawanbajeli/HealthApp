A fever is a temporary rise in body temperature. 
It's one part of an overall response from the 
body's immune system. A fever is usually caused
 by an infection.

For most children and adults, a fever may be 
uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause 
for concern. For infants, however, even a low
 fever may mean there's a serious infection.

Fevers generally go away within a few days.
 A number of over-the-counter medications
 lower a fever. But you don't necessarily 
need to treat a fever if it's not causing 
discomfort.
