A headache is a pain or discomfort in the head, 
scalp, or neck.

Common types of headaches include tension headaches,
 migraine or cluster headaches, sinus headaches, and
 headaches that begin in your neck. You may have a
 mild headache with a cold, the flu, or other viral 
illnesses when you also have a low fever.

Some headaches are a sign of a more serious problem 
and need medical attention right away.


Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors,
 including:

Alcohol, particularly red wine
Certain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitrates
Changes in sleep or lack of sleep
Poor posture
Skipped meals
Stress
